As you may or may not know Lindsay and I have hit a
bit of a rough patch Not tricks Michael illusions I don't criticize you
And if you're worried about criticism
sometimes a diet is the best defense
I don't understand the question and I won't respond to it
Did you enjoy your meal Mom I'm half machine I'm a monster No I was ashamed
to be SEEN with you I like being with you
Only you could make those words cute
I'm doing mental jumping jacks This man is a knight in shining armor
Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others Pretend
You pretend the feelings are there for the world for the
people around you Who knows Maybe one day they will be
